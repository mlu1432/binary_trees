# Binary Trees

This repository contains implementations of various binary tree operations. Each file corresponds to a specific function that manipulates or evaluates binary trees in different ways, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and property checks.

## Project Structure

This project includes several C files each corresponding to a specific binary tree operation, a header file, and a directory containing tests for each operation:

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file that contains all function prototypes and the basic binary tree structure definition.
- `binary_tree_print.c`: Function to print a binary tree visually.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Creates a binary tree node.
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
- `3-binary_tree_delete.c`: Deletes an entire binary tree.
- `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`: Checks if a node is a leaf.
- `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`: Checks if a given node is the root of a binary tree.
- `6-binary_tree_preorder.c`: Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
- `7-binary_tree_inorder.c`: Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.
- `8-binary_tree_postorder.c`: Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.
- `9-binary_tree_height.c`: Measures the height of a binary tree.
- `10-binary_tree_depth.c`: Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
- `11-binary_tree_size.c`: Measures the size of a binary tree.
- `12-binary_tree_leaves.c`: Counts the leaves in a binary tree.
- `13-binary_tree_nodes.c`: Counts the nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
- `14-binary_tree_balance.c`: Measures the balance factor of a binary tree.
- `15-binary_tree_is_full.c`: Checks if a binary tree is full.
- `16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: Checks if a binary tree is perfect.
- `17-binary_tree_sibling.c`: Finds the sibling of a node.
- `18-binary_tree_uncle.c`: Finds the uncle of a node.
- `100-binary_trees_ancestor.c`: Finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.
- `101-binary_tree_levelorder.c`: Goes through a binary tree using level-order traversal.

- `tests/`: Directory containing main files for testing each function.
